## Development Setup

### Code Formatting

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. To set up formatting:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Install the Prettier VS Code extension:

   - Open VS Code
   - Press Cmd+Shift+X (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux)
   - Search for "Prettier - Code formatter"
   - Install the extension by Prettier

3. Code will automatically format on save. You can also manually format all files by running:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Formatting Rules

- Single quotes for strings
- 2-space indentation
- Trailing commas in ES5 style
- 100 character line width
- Semicolons at the end of statements

These rules are defined in `.prettierrc`. Feel free to adjust them if needed, but make sure to discuss any changes with the team first.
